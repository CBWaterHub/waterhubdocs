## What is the Columbia Basin Water Hub?
The Columbia Basin Water Hub (CBWH) is operated by Living Lakes Canada, an organization working towards the long-term 
protection of Canadaâ€™s lakes, rivers, wetlands and watersheds. CBWH is a web-based data portal platform, running a customized 
software system called [CKAN](https://ckan.org/). The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is a web-based application
for the storage and distribution of open data.  It is a powerful data catalogue system, used by numerous governments, 
community groups, and institutions with a need to share data. 

The [CBWH](https://data.cbwaterhub.ca/), was developed and customized by Genki Maps, a geospatial and data management
software consultancy, and continues to be developed by other developers and the community. Customized features of the 
CBWH include auto-loading of data from Excel tables, a map search feature, and a metadata schema specific to the water 
management needs of Living Lakes Canada.


## What is this website for?
This platform was developed by the Water Hub Team to use as a central, easily accessible documentation for general use of 
the CBWH for data retrieval, publishing, and developer support.
