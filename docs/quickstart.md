# Quick Start Guide

The Columbia Basin Water Hub (CBWH), operated by Living Lakes Canada, is a web-based data portal providing access to water 
data in the Columbia Basin. The database uses a customized software system called [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

Start by reading the [Terms of Use](https://data.cbwaterhub.ca/Columbia%20Basin%20Water%20Hub%20Terms%20of%20Use.pdf) posted on our site.

If you have any questions about using the Water Hub, feel free to contact our team, or see our complete User Manual.

## Terminology
In CKAN, a ***Dataset*** is a collection of related data and metadata. Each dataset may contain one or more Resources, which are 
either files uploaded to CKAN, or links to data stored elsewhere. A resource could be a report, a map, a data table, or 
something else. Both datasets and resources have their own metadata.

Each dataset is owned by an ***Organization***, which is a collection of users.  This could be users from a non-profit, a First 
Nation, a specific government department, and so on. Each organization can have a user assigned as an administrator, as
well as editors and members. Each Organization has a profile page on the Water Hub.

In CKAN, ***Groups*** does not refer to groups of users. A “group” in CKAN is really more of a collection of data with a theme—it 
is typically used to group thematically-related datasets. The Groups used by the CBWH will reflect the Hydrologic Region 
that the data pertains to, as defined in this report by Dr. Martin Carver.

## Searching for Data
***Browse Datasets***: Clicking the Datasets menu item takes you to the standard browser view of datasets.  You will see a list 
of datasets with a short description of each. Datasets can be filtered on the left side of the page by Organizations, Groups, 
Tags, Formats or Licenses.

***Search by Map***: Click the Map Search link in the menu bar.  This will bring up a map display with a legend. The points that 
you see on the map are limited to those datasets that your user account can view. Map points can be filtered by the type 
of waterbody you are interested in. Clicking on a point on the map brings up a small pop-up with the dataset’s title and 
a link to the map.  Clicking the link in the popup takes you to the dataset page.

You can also browse data by ***Organization*** (the owners of datasets), Hydrologic Regions of the Columbia Basin (using the 
***Groups page***), or ***search*** by keywords.

## Viewing and Downloading Data
Once you have found a resource of interest, you can download it from the CBWH.

***From the Dataset Page***: The easiest way to download data is by clicking the green Download button for the Resource of 
interest. The dataset page also contains important metadata about the entire dataset.

Or, click the link to the ***Resource Page*** for the resource itself. Here, in addition to downloading the resource, you can 
view more specific metadata about the resource, and for many resources, preview the data and make graphs using the Data 
Explorer.
