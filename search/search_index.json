The database uses a customized software system called CKAN . Start by reading the Terms of Use posted on our site. If you have any questions about using the Water Hub, feel free to contact our team, or see our complete User Manual. Terminology \u00b6 In CKAN, a Dataset is a collection of related data and metadata. Each dataset may contain one or more Resources, which are either files uploaded to CKAN, or links to data stored elsewhere. A resource could be a report, a map, a data table, or something else. Both datasets and resources have their own metadata. Each dataset is owned by an Organization , which is a collection of users. This could be users from a non-profit, a First Nation, a specific government department, and so on. Each organization can have a user assigned as an administrator, as well as editors and members. Each Organization has a profile page on the Water Hub. In CKAN, Groups does not refer to groups of users. A \u201cgroup\u201d in CKAN is really more of a collection of data with a theme\u2014it is typically used to group thematically-related datasets. The Groups used by the CBWH will reflect the Hydrologic Region that the data pertains to, as defined in this report by Dr. Martin Carver. Searching for Data \u00b6 Browse Datasets : Clicking the Datasets menu item takes you to the standard browser view of datasets. You will see a list of datasets with a short description of each. Datasets can be filtered on the left side of the page by Organizations, Groups, Tags, Formats or Licenses. Search by Map : Click the Map Search link in the menu bar. This will bring up a map display with a legend. The points that you see on the map are limited to those datasets that your user account can view. Map points can be filtered by the type of waterbody you are interested in. Clicking on a point on the map brings up a small pop-up with the dataset\u2019s title and a link to the map. Clicking the link in the popup takes you to the dataset page. You can also browse data by Organization (the owners of datasets), Hydrologic Regions of the Columbia Basin (using the Groups page ), or search by keywords. Viewing and Downloading Data \u00b6 Once you have found a resource of interest, you can download it from the CBWH. From the Dataset Page : The easiest way to download data is by clicking the green Download button for the Resource of interest. The dataset page also contains important metadata about the entire dataset. Or, click the link to the Resource Page for the resource itself.

The core concepts or \u201cstructures\u201d used to organize data are Datasets, Resources, Organizations, and Groups. We also discuss Metadata, which is additional information about each dataset and resource. These are discussed in the following sections. 1 Datasets and Resources In CKAN, a dataset is a collection of related data and metadata. Each dataset may contain one or more resources, which are either files uploaded to CKAN, or links to data stored elsewhere. A resource could be a PDF or Word report, a map, a data table, or something else. Both datasets and resources have their own metadata. For the CBWH site, the majority of resources will be Excel files containing tables of various kinds of water monitoring data. Typically, one monitoring station would correspond to one dataset in CKAN. All data tables and reports pertaining to that station would be added as resources to its dataset. A dataset contains two things: Information or \u201cmetadata\u201d about the data. For example, the title and publisher, date, what formats it is available in, what license it is released under, and so on. CBWH uses a custom metadata schema, with metadata fields specific to water monitoring, in addition to the standard CKAN metadata fields. A number of \u201cresources\u201d, which hold the data itself. Resources also have their own resource-level metadata, which is independent from the dataset-level metadata. Organizations \u00b6 Each dataset is owned by an organization, which is a collection of users who belong to a common group. This could be users from a First Nation, users from a specific government department, and so on. The CBWH is expected to eventually have dozens of organizations. Each organization can have its own workflow and authorizations, allowing it to manage its own publishing process. A large organization can break up its data by department, allowing each department to be a separate organization within the CBWH. Each organization can have a user assigned as an administrator. An organization\u2019s administrator can add individual users to it, with different roles depending on the level of authorization needed. Each dataset in CKAN belongs to only one organization. A user in an organization with Editor permissions can create a dataset owned by that organization. By default, this dataset is initially private, and visible only to other users in the same organization. Only logged-in users who are members of the dataset\u2019s organization can see private datasets. When it is ready for sharing outside the organization, it can be made public at the click of a button. A Public dataset is visible to all users of the site. User Permission Levels in Organizations \u00b6 Users added to an organization can have one of three roles: Admin, Editor, or Member. Admin : can view the organization\u2019s private datasets, and all public datasets, can add, delete, and edit datasets, and can add, edit, or delete members or organization. Editor : can view the organization\u2019s private datasets, and all public datasets, and: create and delete datasets within the organization. Member : can view the organization\u2019s private datasets, and all public datasets Groups \u00b6 Groups in CKAN does not refer to user groups. A \u201cgroup\u201d in CKAN is really more of a data theme\u2014it is typically used to group thematically-related datasets. Whenever you see Groups, think of Themes or Categories. Groups are meant for the community of site users to collect related datasets together into themes such as Water Quality. The Groups used by the CBWH will reflect the type of waterbody that a dataset is related to. The current groups are Climate, Groundwater, Lakes, Snow, Streams, Wetlands, and Glaciers. These groups are intended to have a 1:1 correspondence to the Data Type field in the custom metadata, although this relationship is not set in stone. Note that a dataset can belong to more than one group, unlike organizations. Metadata \u00b6 In CKAN, datasets have a default metadata schema, which is a set of fields with information describing the dataset. These include dataset title, summary, maintainer email, parent organization, and keywords, among others. The CBWH has been customized with additional metadata fields related to water monitoring data: Latitude, Longitude, Data Grade, Data Type, Data Collector, Start and End dates, and others. The custom metadata schema is currently fixed, but it can be changed as needed. The list of keywords is restricted to a controlled vocabulary. The Data Type field is categorical, and has a set of data types determined by Living Lakes to best meet the needs of the organizations that will be uploading data. The list of data types corresponds to the Groups in CKAN and also the available layers in the Map Search interface.","title":"Core CKAN Concepts"},{"location":"UserGuide/core/#core-ckan-concepts","text":"","title":"Core CKAN Concepts"},{"location":"UserGuide/core/#datasets-and-resources","text":"This section describes the way in which data and users are organized and displayed in CKAN.

Note that you can only publish data if your account has Editor or higher permissions level. Preparing your Data \u00b6 The CBWH includes a custom extension that automatically loads data from uploaded Excel and csv files, with field type detection, to an internal database within CKAN, called the Datastore. The Datastore allows users to preview the contents of tabular data, extract a subset of that data using a query, and download data in other structured formats such as csv or JSON. For more information on the CKAN Datastore, see: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/datastore.html. Structuring Tabular Data \u00b6 The Datastore loading extension handles data in Excel and csv format, and is designed to be as flexible as possible. There is no requirement for column names or types to match any pre-existing schema for water management data. However, there are a number of restrictions that apply to the format and structure of tabular data. It is impossible for the plugin to bypass these restrictions, so any table that does not match the following list of restrictions will not be loaded to the CKAN Datastore. If this happens, the uploaded file will still be published in CKAN and be downloadable by authorized users, but the Datastore feature specifically will not be enabled for that table. Please review the following restrictions prior to publishing your data. The excel or csv file must have a contiguous rectangular block of data (rows and columns) with a header row. There must be only one header row. There must not be a gap between the header row and the first row of data, even if this improves human readability. Multiple header rows embedded in the data table will cause all columns to be interpreted as text columns. Multiple blocks of data separated by gaps of blank cells will likely cause data loading to fail. Before loading an Excel file, ensure that all hidden columns and rows are visible, and check for any issues with the structure of the table. Each column must contain only a single data type (such as integer, decimal number, text). The data types must be simple, and not composite. For example, two columns Latitude and Longitude, each containing decimal numbers is OK. By contrast, a single column containing a latitude-longitude coordinate will not be interpreted correctly. Columns may contain null values, with the following caveats: if using Excel, a null value is represented as an empty cell with no data at all, not a space character, zero, underscore, a formula that evaluates to a blank cell such as =\u201d\u201d, or any other data. If using csv, a null value is represented as a pair of commas with no space or quote marks between them: ,, Any other representation of null in a csv is likely to be interpreted as a text object, and cause the entire column to become a text field. Excel files must not have any graphs, pictures, comments, formulas, or other objects embedded in the data table. Avoid using merged cells anywhere in the file. The header row does not have to be on the first row, but there must be a header row somewhere in the file. You will have to provide the Excel/csv row number of the header row when uploading your file; it cannot be reliably auto-detected, and cases where the header row is not on the first row are sufficiently common that a default of assuming that the first row is the header row is not sensible. The header row number starts from 1 on the first row; it is not zero-indexed. If you leave the header row field blank, or enter an invalid row number, the file will be published as a resource in CKAN, but it will not be loaded to the CKAN Datastore. The header row must contain only SQL-compatible column names, meaning only alphanumeric characters and underscores (no spaces, brackets, commas, hyphens, or other special characters), and less than 63 characters long. Internally, all column names will be converted to lowercase before loading the table to the Datastore. Note that this only applies to the copy of the table that is loaded to the Datastore; the original column names in your csv or Excel file will remain as they were when you uploaded the file. In CKAN, a resource can only have one table loaded to the Datastore. If the Excel file has multiple spreadsheets, only the first one will be imported in the Datastore. However, the original Excel file will not be modified; if you have multiple sheets in the uploaded file, they will remain unchanged when users download the original file. If you have an Excel file with multiple sheets that you want to have loaded in the Datastore, please copy each sheet to a new Excel file, and create a new resource for each of these files. Creating a Dataset \u00b6 On the CBWH site, on the Dataset page, click Add Dataset. If you do not see the Add Dataset button, your account does not have the access level required to create datasets. This is a two-step process. In the first step, you will see a series of metadata fields, including basic fields like Title and Summary, along with others specific to water monitoring. If you are creating a dataset for which some of these fields do not apply, simply leave them blank. The metadata schema is designed to be inclusive of all possible data types that might be published by Living Lakes, so it is likely that some of the fields will be blank for every dataset you create. Upload and Wait for Publication \u00b6 On the next page, either click Upload to upload a data file, or click Link to add a link to a dataset that is hosted on an external website. If uploading a tabular data file, please be sure to enter the header row number. Also be sure to correctly enter the format. The format can be detected from the file extension, but this is not always reliable. If you upload an Excel or csv file with a header row defined, the Datastore loading extension will be triggered in the background, and will attempt to load your data to the Datastore. While this is happening, the site will redirect you to the resource page for the file you just uploaded. It is likely to take anywhere from a few seconds to many minutes before your data becomes available in the Datastore. One of the metadata fields in the resource page shows the status of data loading. This field will contain one of the following: an in-progress message, a completed message with the number of rows loaded, or an error message. Once the process is complete, refresh the page to see your table in the datastore, which shows roughly the first 25 rows in a table embedded at the top of the resource page in CKAN. If instead of the data table preview, you see the message \u201cThere are no views created for this resource yet\u201d it means that the Datastore load failed for this table. Scroll down to the Loading Status section below and there may be an error or status message. If this still does not clarify the reason that data loading failed, please contact a site administrator. File Size Limit \u00b6 There is an upload size limit of approximately 900MB per file. If you need to upload files larger than this, please contact a site administrator to arrange an alternative data workflow. Please remember to be mindful with zip files that may cross the 900MB size, and contact us with any questions. Generally, data in Excel will consume less space than the same data in csv format.","title":"Data Publishing"},{"location":"UserGuide/publishing/#publishing-data","text":"This section describes how to publish your data on the CBWH.

This section describes ways to carry out data searches, narrow results by filtering, download data, and query subsets of data. Searching for Data \u00b6 There are several ways to search for data in the CBWH: 1. Search By Map \u00b6 This is an entirely new feature, customized for the CBWH. Click the Map Search link in the menu bar. This will bring up a map display with a legend. The points on the map correspond to all datasets that have a latitude, longitude, and data type in their metadata. One point is shown for each dataset, but a single dataset may contain multiple resources. For example, a dataset for a water quality monitoring station at a fixed location might have a data table (resource) for each year of data collection. The points that you see on the map are limited to those datasets that your user account can view. For example, a private dataset in an organization that you are not a member of will not appear on the map. As with most web maps, use the mouse to pan around and the mouse wheel to zoom in and out; there is also a zoom control at top right. The map by default is zoomed to the Columbia River basin. There are buttons on the left to zoom to this extent, or to the full extent of all datasets. The Layer Controller on the left shows the list of all data types in the datasets that you can view. Use the check mark next to each data type to turn the layer on or off. If a dataset has more than one data type, there will be a stack of points. Use the layer controller to filter only the data types that you would like to see. Clicking on a point on the map brings up a small pop-up with the dataset\u2019s title and a link to the map. Clicking the link in the popup takes you to the dataset page. If more than one dataset has the same latitude-longitude coordinate, the popup will contain links to all datasets at that coordinate. 2. Browse Datasets \u00b6 Clicking the Datasets menu item takes you to the standard browser view of datasets. You will see a list of datasets with a short description of each. By default, these are sorted by Relevance, but if you have not entered any search keywords, the default arrangement is the same as Last Modified. The Order By menu at the top-right has more options for sorting this list of datasets. Datasets can be filtered on the left side of the page by Organizations, Groups, Tags, Formats or Licenses. Similar to the map search, you will only see those datasets that your user account has permission to view. 3. Text Search \u00b6 The text box at the top of this view has a fairly good full-text search engine. The indexing is based on significance of keywords in the document. So, for example, if you search for \u201cwater quality,\u201d results with that phrase in the title or near the beginning of the summary will appear highest in the list. The following search operations may be used to perform more precise searches: Search Operator Example Effect Minus (-) -columbia -estuary water quality Excludes Terms or phrases from the search. In this example, the search returns datasets for the search water quality without the terms columbia or estuary in the returned results, which helps to exclude unwanted information. Quotation Mark (\" \") \u201cwater quality\u201d Makes an exact-match search of the quoted phrase. In this example, the search returns datasets that contain the whole quoted phrase water quality, which helps refine search results. AND Canal Flats AND water quality Finds datasets related to multiple phrases. In this example, the search returns datasets that are related to both Canal flats and water quality, which helps narrow the search. It is possible to combine the search operators to create more customized searches. 4. Browse by Group \u00b6 Categories are broad topics of interest used to group similar datasets and include Climate, Groundwater, Lakes, Snow, Streams, Wetlands, and Glacier. Some datasets are associated with more than one category. Categories can be found at the bottom of the home page or under the Groups menu. 5. Browse by Organization \u00b6 Click the Organization menu, then click on the organization of choice to see all public datasets belonging to the organization. If you are a member of the organization, you will also see its private datasets. Filtering Search Results \u00b6 After searching or browsing for datasets, you may wish to filter the list to further narrow the results. A search can be filtered by resource file format, group, organization, tag, or license, or any combination of these. Filters are found on the left side of the search page. Filtering by Format \u00b6 Since resources can be provided in multiple formats, clicking on one format in the left panel will filter the results to show only datasets with resources distributed in that format. You may further filter the results by selecting additional formats; only datasets containing resources with both file formats selected will be returned. Filter by Group \u00b6 Since datasets may be related to multiple collections/groups, clicking on one group will filter the results to show only datasets of that collection/category. However you may filter further to show those resources from the originally selected group that also fall into and one or more additional groups. Filter by Organization \u00b6 Each dataset is linked to a single organization. While you can filter by organization, it is not possible to select a second organization filter, since datasets cannot belong to more than one organization. Filter by Tag \u00b6 Each dataset can have multiple keyword tags associated with it. You can filter search results by tags; as many tags as desired can be used as filters. Filtering by Licence \u00b6 Datasets in the CBWH may have a license associated with them. Clicking on one of the license types will filter the results to only show datasets with that license. Datasets without a license type are tagged as \u201cLicense Not Specified.\u201d Combining Filters \u00b6 Datasets in the SSDC may have a license associated with them. Clicking on one of the license types will filter the results to only show datasets with that license. Datasets without a license type are tagged as \u201cLicense Not Specified.\u201d To clear selected filters, click the X next to the filters you wish to remove, either at the top of the search results page, or in the filters panel on the left side of the page. Other Filtering Tips \u00b6 If you want to use a filter that is not listed, click on the \u201cShow More \u2026\u201d button at the bottom of each filter category. If the desired filter term still does not appear, add the topic of interest into the search bar. The filters most related to the search topic should now appear in the list of filters. Accessing Data \u00b6 Once you have found a resource of interest, you can download it from the CBWH. Download from the Dataset Page \u00b6 Every dataset has an ID, which is a URL-friendly version of the name in lowercase. You will see the dataset ID at the end of its url, for example a URL ending with /dataset/flow-data is the \u201cdataset page\u201d for the dataset \u201cFlow Data.\u201d The easiest way to download data is by clicking the green Download button for data of interest. This allows you to download the data in its original format (usually Excel, for the CBWH). On the Explore drop-down menu, there are additional options. The Download option on this menu is the same action as the green Download button. Preview brings you to a page where you can preview the data table (if the data is tabular) or file (preview is supported for PDF and common image formats). Download from the Resource Page \u00b6 To open the Resource page, click the link for the name of the data file, in this example \u201cLarge file test.\u201d This brings you to the resource page for a data file. If the data is tabular, and has been successfully loaded to the CKAN Datastore, you will see a preview of the first few rows of the table. If the data is a PDF or image file, there will be a preview below. You can also download data from this page. To do so, simply click the Download button near the top-right, avoiding the down arrow at the right edge of this button. If the data is tabular, you also have additional download options in different format, which can be accessed by clicking the down arrow at the right side of the button. However, downloading data in its original format is recommended. Programmatic Data Access and Query \u00b6 For tabular data, it is possible to query a subset of the data, instead of downloading the entire file at once. This can be useful, for example, if you want only data collected within a certain date range, or only values that exceed some threshold. In the CBWH, supported Excel files are automatically loaded into the CKAN Datastore. The datastore supports querying data using a SQL query. SQL querying is beyond the scope of this document, but tutorials and example queries are widely available online. For more information about the CKAN Datastore, see: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/datastore.html. Example Query \u00b6 On the resource page for tabular data, you will see a green Data API button at the top-right. Querying can be done from your web browser, or from R, Python, or any other programming language that supports HTTP requests and JSON. Results from queries against tables in the datastore are provided in the JSON format (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). On the resource page for tabular data, you will see a green Data API button at the top-right. Click this to see examples of querying in action. Querying can be done from your web browser, or from R, Python, or any other programming language that supports HTTP requests and JSON. Results from queries against tables in the datastore are provided in the JSON format (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). For example: https://data.cbwaterhub.ca/dataset/lardeau-river-nhlar02/resource/dd2d8d49-6d61-42b7-b695-0c81c2cdfa52 In this example, the resource ID is: dd2d8d49-6d61-42b7-b695-0c81c2cdfa52. When performing an SQL query, the resource ID is the SQL table name. In the database behind CKAN, the table \u201cc730d8a6-997c-436c-8c9e-795f91588c0e\u201d contains all of the data (rows and columns) that was pulled from the uploaded Excel file. Below is a simple line to get the first 5 rows: https://data.cbwaterhub.ca/api/3/action/datastore_search?resource_id=dd2d8d49-6d61-42b7-b695-0c81c2cdfa52&limit=5 You can use this url for various applications using your preferred programming language like Python or Javascript. For sql queries, the CBWH datastore URL is: https://data.cbwaterhub.ca/api/3/action/datastore_search_sql?sql= In general, you can run any SQL query on any table in the datastore.
